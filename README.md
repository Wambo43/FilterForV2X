# FilterForV2X
Master Work

With the software it is possible to generate vehicle traffic based on traffic density. The generated vehicle messages feed the filter. Based on the bandwidth, the filter will output a list which is adapted for the forwarding of the vehicle messages to the bandwidth. The filter will work according to the pattern "Sort by Prioritize". This one will get a list of messages. The unsorted list will consist of CAM and DENM messages. The output list is grouped in two parts. One group is made up of DENMs and the other is made up of CAMs.
